The DataLoader class provides methods for loading data into a Python environment. The class has two methods, `load_test_data` and `load`. 

- `load_test_data` downloads a simple dataset for testing purposes. The method uses the `request` function from the `requests` module to send an HTTP GET request to a URL that points to a pickle file.

- `load` loads images from local storage. The method accepts a list of file paths as input and returns a list of PIL.Image objects. This method can be used to load images from local storage into a Python environment for image processing purposes.
