This Python class named `CellCounter` is used to count the number of cells from the cell masks generated by a neural network model. 

The class has two methods:
- `count_cells_buccal` takes an object of class `BuccalSwabSegmentation`, which contains two types of masks: `epithelial_masks` and `immune_masks`. The method calls the `count_cells_from_masks` method and passes the two masks as arguments to it. The method returns the count of cells in both the masks.
- `count_cells_from_masks` is the core method of the class which accepts one or more masks as arguments, counts the number of cells in each mask, and returns the count as a tuple or an integer, depending on the number of masks provided. The method can take a mask in either of the two formats: `.txt` or `.npy`. 

If the mask is in `.txt` format, it reads the file, counts the number of lines, and returns it as the count. If the mask is in `.npy` format, it loads the file using NumPy, extracts the masks, and counts the number of cells in the masks using the `outlines_list` function from the `cellpose.utils` module.

If the mask is not in either `.txt` or `.npy` format, the method logs an error message and raises a `ValueError`. 

The class doesn't have any attributes, and its constructor (`__init__`) is empty.
